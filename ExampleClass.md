# Example Player Class

You can download an example class here. Adding this file to the game will dynamically add it to the class list along with all its traits. This should give you an idea of what a working class looks like. The class itself is a Zombieman with a chaingun and rocket launcher altfire, nothing special. The traits have no function and are added to show a working example.
