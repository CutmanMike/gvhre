The following are variables GVH:RE server hosts can change. For basic Zandronum server settings, check this site: https://wiki.zandronum.com/DMFlags

## gvh_sv_damagenumbers
Allows the use of damagenumbers, which players can toggle on or off in the options.

Defaulted to *true*.

## gvh_sv_notraits
Disables the trait system in TLMS.

## gvh_sv_timer
The time (in minutes) before the circle of fire spawns. The circle will close in and damage players outside the circle, encouraging players to hurry up.

Defaulted to *15 minutes*.

## gvh_sv_dontfastforwardbots
Disables the bot fast forwarding system. If no players are left in the match, bots are teleported near eachother to speed up the round.

## gvh_sv_norepositionteams
Disables the team repositioning system. At the start of the match, players will be spawn together in a single area far away from the enemy team. Automatically disalbed for GVH## maps, as they have specific team spawning spots.

## gvh_sv_allowmapvoting
Allows the use of the map voting system. Spectators and dead players can vote for the next map using chat commands, and get thumbnails of the maps they are voting for.

Defaulted to *true*.
